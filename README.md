# sph-cloud-collapse
The following code modelates the collapse of a molecular cloud. The code was done in the masters course "Advanced topics of astrophysics". 

This firs version was done by Andrés Gómez and David Felipe Barros. 

The code is mainly based in J. C. Lattanzio, J. J. Monaghan, H. Pongracic, M. P. Schwarz (1985). And in the book Smoothed Particle 
Hydrodynamics: A Meshfree Particle Method of G.R. Liu and M.B. Liu. 

Results of the time of collapse are consisten with the theory, next work is ti add sink particles to modelate the stellar evolution.
